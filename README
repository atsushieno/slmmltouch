SlMMLTouch is a ported library of SlMML (svn r138). Notable changes are:

	- removed Japanese characeters (comments and #region names), which
	  somehow crash MonoDevelop text editor.
	- removed dependency on Silverlight MediaStreamSource and MediaElement.
	- added some support classes for MonoTouch and CoreAudio.

SlMMLTouchApp is a proof of concept example iPad application (not really done).
So far it has a text box to write MML text and a play button.
Play operation somehow causes crash (heisenbug), and it does not perform well.
